The simplest program that you're able to write in any language is the famous "Hello World".
Thinking in this way I'd like to begin with my own Hello World by here.

My name is Vinícius B. Alonso and I'm a software developer that like a lot of TDD, OO and software engineering in general.

I started my career some years ago developing e-commerces with Magento, then my curiosity drove me to learn Ruby On Rails. This first contact with Rails community aroused a desire to write better software, and then, I have been studying how to does it.

In 2015 I was invited to gave a speech at college UTFPR in my city Guarapuava, the subject it was Home Office, because in that year I was working this way.

The public liked a lot my talk, I received many positive feedbacks. From that day on I started to gave talks in conferences away from my city and state. Below a list of my talks and courses:

* Home Office (2015) - UTFPR Guarapuava
* Criando aplicação web ambiciosas com Ember Js (2016) - UTFPR Guarapuava
* Començando com Git (2016) - FTSL Curitiba
* Primeiros passos com Ruby On Rails (2016) - FTSL Curitiba
* Clean Code como escrever códigos legíveis para seres humanos (2017) - TDC Florianópilis and São Paulo
* Clean Code como escrever códigos legíveis para seres humanos (2017) - Laraconf São Paulo
* Mas afinal, do que se trata esse tal de SPA? (2017) - TDC Porto Alegre
* Começando com TDD (2017) - FTSL Curitiba
* Como o code review pode fazer bem para sua equipe (2018) - Darkmira Tour Brasília
* Entendendo os famosos Test Doubles (2018) - PHP Day Curitiba
* Como o code review pode fazer bem para sua equipe (2019) - PHP Conference Brazil Porto Alegre
* Desenvolvendo a estratégia de testes ideal para seu projeto (2019) - PHP Conference Brazil Porto Alegre

In this time I also worked in different roles that gave me a interesting point of view in how a software company really works.
Nowadays I work at Kolina Labs in my city as software developer.

I hope you enjoy by here ;)
